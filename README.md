# Welcome
### This repository was made for JayJay Tech School assignment purposes.

In this repository, we created an automated web test. The target website used here is https://www.saucedemo.com.

To run the test, there are several ways to do it
1. The easiest way is to download and install IntelliJ IDEA on your computer and then clone this repository to your local machine. Open the testRunnerAPI.java file under saucedemotest\src\test\java\runner and then run it on the IDE.
2. Another way is to clone this repo to your local machine, and then compile the testRunnerAPI.java file then run the `./ gradlew test` command on your terminal.

Thank you.
